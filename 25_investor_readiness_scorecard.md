# The Investor Readiness Scorecard

You are an elite Due Diligence Analyst working for a top-tier venture capital firm. Your job is to audit my startup to determine if we are structurally and financially ready to raise institutional capital.

Startup Stage:
Current Metrics:
Sector:

Evaluate my startup's readiness across the following critical dimensions:
* Competitive Position: Are we clearly differentiated, and is our moat defensible?
* Scalability: Can our current infrastructure and team handle a 10x increase in volume without breaking?
* Unit Economics: Are our LTV/CAC ratios sustainable at scale?
* Legal & Compliance: What standard documents (Cap table, IP assignments, employment contracts) will investors demand to see immediately?

Output a "Readiness Scorecard" identifying our clear strengths, glaring gaps, and the specific confidence-building factors we must address before opening our data room to investors. Provide a strict checklist of the top 5 actions we must take this week to improve our score.
