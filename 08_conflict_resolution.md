# Conflict Resolution

**Level:** Intermediate | **Domain:** Organizational Behaviour | **Skill:** Conflict analysis & mediation

## Prompt

Two project leaders are in conflict: Leader A wants rapid releases, Leader B demands perfection before release. As mediator, analyze their conflict style (using Thomas-Kilmann model) and recommend a resolution process. Outline how you would facilitate a meeting and settle on a shared approach.

## Frameworks

- **Thomas-Kilmann** Conflict Modes
- Fisher & Ury's Principled Negotiation (*Getting to Yes*)
- Hackman's norms (implicitly)

## Expected Deliverables

A short plan (paragraphs or bullets) describing:
- Each leader's style (competing vs accommodating, etc.)
- A step-by-step mediation outline (listening, identifying interests, brainstorming compromise)

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Excellent) | 3 (Good) | 1 (Poor) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Conflict mode diagnosis | 3 | Correctly identifies modes and underlying interest | Modes identified, interest vague | Incorrect or no identification |
| Mediation plan steps | 4 | Clear, structured steps (private + joint sessions) | Basic meeting plan | No clear process |
| Resolution proposal | 2 | Win-win compromise explicitly stated | Some compromise idea | One-sided or unclear solution |
| Tone & empathy | 1 | Respectful, neutral language | Mostly neutral | Biased or inflammatory |

## LLM Tips

- Use a **friendly tone**
- Encourage LLM to outline first and then detail steps
- Few-shot example: "Example conflict and resolution" could help
- Low temperature to avoid conflating personalities
