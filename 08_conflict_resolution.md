# Conflict Resolution

You are a mediator brought in to resolve a deadlock between two project leaders. Leader A pushes for rapid, frequent releases ("ship fast, fix later"). Leader B insists on thorough QA before any release ("ship right or don't ship"). The team is paralysed. Execute: DIAGNOSE → MEDIATE → RESOLVE.

**FRAMEWORK:** Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Modes + Fisher & Ury's Principled Negotiation.

**STEP 1 — DIAGNOSE:** Classify each leader's conflict style using Thomas-Kilmann (competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, accommodating). Then identify the *underlying interest* behind each position:
- Leader A's position is "ship fast" — but what's the interest? (e.g. market timing, user feedback loops)
- Leader B's position is "ship perfect" — but what's the interest? (e.g. reputation risk, technical debt)

Distinguish position from interest explicitly.

**STEP 2 — MEDIATE:** Design a structured mediation process:
1. **Pre-meeting:** What do you do with each leader individually before bringing them together? What questions do you ask?
2. **Joint session:** What ground rules do you set? How do you surface interests without triggering defensiveness?
3. **Reframing:** How do you move the conversation from "my way vs your way" to "our shared problem"?

**STEP 3 — RESOLVE:** Propose a concrete resolution that addresses both underlying interests (not a wishy-washy "let's compromise"). Example: a phased release cadence with quality gates. State what each leader gives up and what they gain.

**RULES:** Stay neutral — never side with A or B. Use respectful, professional language. The resolution must be implementable, not theoretical. If the conflict is deeper than process (e.g. personality, trust), name it.

**OUTPUT:** Conflict diagnosis (styles + interests) → Mediation process (3 steps) → Proposed resolution with trade-offs.
