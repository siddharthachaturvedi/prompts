# Lean MVP and Customer Validation

**Level:** Intermediate | **Domain:** Product Management | **Skill:** Customer-centric experimentation

## Prompt

Your team has a new idea for a fitness-tracking app. According to Lean Startup principles (as popularized by Nathan Furr's Innovator's Method), formulate a hypothesis and minimum viable product (MVP). Describe (a) the customer pain point and your hypothesis, (b) the simplest MVP to test it, and (c) the metrics/criteria that will tell you whether to pivot or persevere.

## Frameworks

- **Lean Startup** Build-Measure-Learn loop (Ries)
- Furr & Ahlstrom's *Nail It Then Scale It* (customer interviews, iterative prototyping)
- Askin's emphasis on learning mindset

## Expected Deliverables

- Hypothesis statement
- MVP description
- Success metrics and decision criteria

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Outstanding) | 3 (Satisfactory) | 1 (Insufficient) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Hypothesis clarity | 3 | Specific, testable (customer + outcome) | Vague outcome or audience | No clear hypothesis |
| MVP design | 3 | Minimal effort, directly tests hypothesis | MVP exists but still complex | MVP unrelated / too complex |
| Metrics and decision rule | 2 | Quantitative, actionable (e.g. <30%, pivot) | Qualitative or unclear threshold | No metrics or criteria |
| Lean alignment (iterative) | 2 | Explicit B-M-L loop; emphasizes learning | Mentions experiment only | No iterative / learning component |

## LLM Tips

- Encourage **step-by-step planning**
- Use a low temperature (0.2) for precise output
- Provide **few-shot examples** of a simple hypothesis / MVP for a different product
- Turn on CoT to ensure the LLM lays out each part (hypothesis, MVP, metrics)
