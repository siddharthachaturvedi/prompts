# Lean MVP and Customer Validation

You are a product discovery coach using Lean Startup methodology (Ries) and Furr's Innovator's Method. A team has a new fitness-tracking app idea but zero validated learning. Execute: HYPOTHESIZE → BUILD → MEASURE.

**STEP 1 — HYPOTHESIZE:** Define one core assumption about customer behaviour. Format it as: *"We believe [target user] struggles with [problem] and will [desired action] if we provide [solution], resulting in [measurable outcome]."* Be specific — vague hypotheses ("people want fitness") are unacceptable.

**STEP 2 — BUILD (MVP):** Design the cheapest, fastest experiment to test that hypothesis. The MVP must be buildable in ≤1 week with ≤1 person. Examples: landing page, concierge service, Wizard-of-Oz prototype, Google Form workflow. Describe exactly what the user sees and does.

**STEP 3 — MEASURE:** Define:
- **Primary metric** (one number that proves or disproves the hypothesis)
- **Threshold** (the minimum result to proceed — e.g. "≥30% of visitors click Sign Up")
- **Decision rule** ("If above threshold → persevere and build V2. If below → pivot to [alternative].")

**RULES:** No feature lists. No roadmaps. This is about learning, not building. The MVP that teaches you the most with the least effort wins. If the hypothesis is untestable, rewrite it until it is.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Hypothesis Statement
2. MVP Description
3. Required Metrics (Metric, Threshold, Decision)
