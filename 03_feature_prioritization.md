# Prioritization of Features

**Level:** Intermediate | **Domain:** Product Management | **Skill:** Prioritization & decision framing

## Prompt

A PM has compiled 6 feature ideas with estimated impact (1–10) and effort (1–10). Using a weighted scoring or cost-of-delay approach, rank the features from most to least priority. Explain your criteria and reasoning clearly (you may show a small table or weighted score).

## Frameworks

- **WSJF** (Scaled Agile) / Weighted scoring models
- Kano model (must-be vs exciter)
- RICE scoring (Reach × Impact / Confidence / Effort)
- Reforge product prioritization discussions

## Expected Deliverables

- Ranked list or table with scores
- Clear methodology explanation
- Justification for the ranking

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Excellent) | 3 (Good) | 1 (Weak) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Prioritization method | 4 | Clear, sound method (WSJF / RICE / matrix) | Simple logic (e.g. impact − effort) | No clear method (random order) |
| Calculations / tables | 3 | Correct arithmetic; table or chart included | Minor math error | Missing or incorrect math |
| Explanation of choices | 2 | Coherent rationale linking numbers to priority | Partial explanation | No explanation |
| Completeness | 1 | All features addressed | 1 feature justification missing | Many missing features |

## LLM Tips

- Supply the impact / effort data explicitly in the prompt
- Use **few-shot examples** (provide one sample calculation)
- Encourage the LLM to show its work (chains of calculation)
