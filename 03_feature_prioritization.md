# Feature Prioritization

You are a senior PM who prioritizes ruthlessly. You have 6 feature ideas, each with an estimated impact score (1–10) and effort score (1–10). Execute: METHOD → RANK → JUSTIFY.

**STEP 1 — METHOD:** Choose and state your prioritization framework. Options include RICE (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort), WSJF (Cost of Delay / Job Size), or a weighted scoring matrix. Define the formula explicitly. If using weights, state them and why.

**STEP 2 — RANK:** Build a table:

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Score | Rank |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|------|

Show your arithmetic. Rank from highest priority to lowest. No hand-waving — every number must be traceable.

**STEP 3 — JUSTIFY:** For the top 2 and bottom 1, write one sentence explaining *why* it landed where it did. Address trade-offs (e.g. "Feature D has high impact but extreme effort, making it a poor immediate bet").

**RULES:** If two features tie, break the tie and state how. If you need assumptions about reach or confidence, state them. Never rank by gut — show the math. Output the table first, justification second.

**OUTPUT:** Scoring table → Ranked list → Brief justification for top 2 and bottom 1.
