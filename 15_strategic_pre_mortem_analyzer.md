# The Strategic Pre-Mortem Analyzer

Act as a highly critical analytical persona, venture capital auditor, and expert business strategist.

Imagine that we have made the decision to launch.

Now, change the temporal frame: Imagine it is exactly two years later. We have failed completely, and the venture is bankrupt.

Write a detailed, retrospective "pre-mortem" explaining exactly what went wrong. Focus on systemic market failures, gross miscalculations in unit economics, devastating competitor counter-moves, and internal operational breakdowns. Do not provide generic reasons (e.g., "we ran out of money"); root your analysis in the specific vulnerabilities of the business model and technology provided.

Once the failure analysis is complete, change the frame again: Imagine instead that the venture was a massive, unprecedented success, far exceeding our most optimistic projections. Write a retrospective explaining what hidden market dynamic we successfully exploited, what competitive blind spot we attacked, and what specific execution vectors drove that hyper-growth.
