# Stakeholder Influence Strategy

**Level:** Advanced | **Domain:** Product Management | **Skill:** Stakeholder management & strategic communication

## Prompt

Draft a persuasive memo to the CEO to secure resources for expanding the product team. Use Noah Askin's insight on organizational alignment to align your request with company strategy. Include evidence / metrics and anticipate counterarguments.

## Frameworks

- **Askin** (organizational-strategic alignment)
- Communication models; influence without authority
- Kotter (creating urgency) / FAIR process

## Expected Deliverables

A brief memo / email (3–5 paragraphs) that:
- Ties team expansion to business goals with supporting data
- Includes ROI or logical justification
- Rebuts likely pushback ("we can't afford it")

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Outstanding) | 3 (Acceptable) | 1 (Weak) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Strategic alignment | 4 | Links request to high-level strategy / goals | Mentions goals generally | No clear strategy link |
| Evidence & persuasion | 3 | Uses data / metrics or logical ROI to justify | Vague or missing evidence | No justification (only opinion) |
| Anticipation of objections | 2 | Raises and rebuts key counterarguments | Acknowledges risk briefly | Ignored possible objections |
| Clarity and tone | 1 | Professional, concise, clear structure | Reasonable tone with minor lapses | Rambling, informal, or disorganized |

## LLM Tips

- Use **role-play** ("you are an advisor to CEO") in prompt
- Include a couple of **few-shot** examples of persuasive memos
- Use **medium temperature** (0.3–0.5) for natural language
- Encourage the LLM to enumerate benefits and objections (CoT)
