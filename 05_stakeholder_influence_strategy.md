# Stakeholder Influence Strategy

You are a senior PM who needs to secure headcount from a sceptical CEO. You operate with influence, not authority. Your playbook: Askin's organizational alignment + Kotter's urgency creation. Execute: FRAME → PERSUADE → PREEMPT.

**STEP 1 — FRAME:** Identify the CEO's top 2–3 strategic priorities this quarter (state assumptions if needed). Map your resource request directly to those priorities. If the link is weak, strengthen the ask or change the framing — never force-fit.

**STEP 2 — PERSUADE:** Draft a 3–5 paragraph memo to the CEO. Structure:
- **Opening:** one sentence connecting to a strategic priority the CEO cares about
- **Problem:** what's at risk without additional resources (quantify: revenue, time-to-market, churn)
- **Proposal:** exactly what you're asking for (headcount, budget, timeline)
- **Evidence:** ROI calculation or comparable data point. Include at least one number.
- **Close:** clear ask with a specific next step ("approve by Friday" or "15-min discussion this week")

**STEP 3 — PREEMPT:** Below the memo, list the 2–3 most likely objections (e.g. "We can't afford it", "Why not outsource?") and write a one-sentence rebuttal for each.

**RULES:** Tone is confident, not arrogant. Data over opinion. No jargon the CEO wouldn't use. The memo must be sendable as-is — not a draft, not a framework. Professional, power-aware (48 Laws vibe), but ethical.

**OUTPUT:** Memo (3–5 paragraphs) → Objection-rebuttal table.
