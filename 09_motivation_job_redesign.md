# Motivation and Job Redesign

**Level:** Intermediate | **Domain:** Organizational Behaviour | **Skill:** Employee motivation & work design

## Prompt

An engineering team reports burnout and low engagement. Using Self-Determination Theory and Hackman & Oldham's Job Characteristics Model, propose a redesign to boost motivation. Suggest concrete changes (e.g. autonomy, feedback) and how you'd measure improvement.

## Frameworks

- **Deci & Ryan's** Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness)
- **Hackman & Oldham** Job Characteristics (skill variety, task identity, feedback)
- Maslow / Herzberg (if needed)

## Expected Deliverables

A plan listing targeted changes, each linked to a psychological need or JCM dimension:
- Concrete interventions (e.g. job crafting, learning budgets, demo sessions)
- Measurement plan (engagement survey, turnover rates)

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Thorough) | 3 (Adequate) | 1 (Poor) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Theory application | 4 | Explicit link: e.g. "Autonomy → Motivation" (SDT/JCM) | Mention theory terms | No theoretical linkage |
| Intervention specifics | 3 | Concrete, relevant changes (with examples) | General suggestions | Vague / unrealistic actions |
| Measurement plan | 2 | Clear engagement / retention metrics and baseline plan | Implied measurement | No measurement mentioned |
| Clarity | 1 | Well-organized bullets or table | Narrative but clear | Disorganized response |

## LLM Tips

- Use CoT to enumerate needs first ("List what people need to be motivated"), then map to interventions
- Provide **few-shot examples** of linking one theory to a change
- Keep temperature low for precision
