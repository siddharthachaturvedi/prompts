# Motivation and Job Redesign

You are an OB specialist called in by a VP of Engineering. The team is burnt out: engagement scores dropped 30% YoY, voluntary attrition is 2× the company average, and "quiet quitting" is visible. Execute: DIAGNOSE → REDESIGN → MEASURE.

**FRAMEWORK:** Deci & Ryan's Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness) + Hackman & Oldham's Job Characteristics Model (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback).

**STEP 1 — DIAGNOSE:** Map the team's current state against SDT's three needs:
- **Autonomy:** How much control do engineers have over *what* they work on and *how*?
- **Competence:** Are they growing, or doing repetitive ticket work?
- **Relatedness:** Do they feel connected to the team and the mission?

For each need, rate the current state (starved / adequate / thriving) and cite one observable indicator.

**STEP 2 — REDESIGN:** Propose 4–5 concrete changes, each mapped to a specific JCM dimension or SDT need. Format:

| Change | SDT Need / JCM Dimension | Expected Effect |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| e.g. "20% time for self-directed projects" | Autonomy | Restores agency over work |

No vague advice. "Improve culture" is not a change. "Weekly demo session where any engineer can present work-in-progress to the team" is.

**STEP 3 — MEASURE:** Define how you'll know it's working:
- **Leading indicators** (measurable within 30 days): e.g. participation in optional sessions
- **Lagging indicators** (measurable within 90 days): e.g. engagement survey delta, attrition rate
- **Baseline:** what you'll measure against

**RULES:** Every intervention must be deployable by the VP without needing CEO approval. No budget-heavy solutions unless justified. Link every change to theory by name.

**OUTPUT:** Diagnosis table (need | current state | indicator) → Redesign table → Measurement plan.
