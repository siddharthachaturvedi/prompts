# Blue Ocean Value Innovation

**Level:** Advanced | **Domain:** Product Management | **Skill:** Strategic market innovation

## Prompt

You are consulting for a smartphone manufacturer stuck in a bloody market. Using Kim & Mauborgne's Blue Ocean Four Actions framework, reconstruct the competitive strategy: identify which industry factors to **Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, and Create**. Propose a new strategic profile that breaks the value-cost trade-off to open a "blue ocean."

## Frameworks

- **Blue Ocean Strategy** (Kim & Mauborgne) — Four Actions and ERRC grid
- Value Innovation concept
- Porter's value chain (implicitly)

## Expected Deliverables

- A four-part analysis (Eliminate / Reduce / Raise / Create) with concrete suggestions
- A strategic value curve summary (bullets or mini chart)

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Outstanding) | 3 (Adequate) | 1 (Poor) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Four Actions analysis | 4 | All 4 categories addressed with insightful suggestions | 3 categories with acceptable reasoning | Missing <3 or irrelevant actions |
| Strategic insight | 3 | New profile convincingly breaks value-cost trade-off | Modest differentiation, some gaps | Strategy remains "red ocean" |
| Alignment to evidence | 2 | Arguments tied to buyer needs / competitor data | General reasoning only | No evidence or logic |
| Clarity and organization | 1 | Well-structured (bullets or diagram + summary) | Basic structure, minor omissions | Disorganized, hard to follow |

## LLM Tips

- Use **chain-of-thought (CoT)** to list each action stepwise
- Set **moderate temperature** (0.3–0.5) for coherence
- Provide **1–2 few-shot examples** (e.g. a different industry's Blue Ocean case)
- Encourage stepwise decomposition ("First Eliminate, then Reduce, …")
