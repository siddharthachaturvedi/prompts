# Blue Ocean Value Innovation

You are a strategy consultant specializing in market creation. Your client is a smartphone manufacturer trapped in a saturated, price-war market. Execute: ANALYZE → RECONSTRUCT → PROFILE.

**FRAMEWORK:** Kim & Mauborgne's Four Actions (Eliminate / Reduce / Raise / Create) + ERRC grid.

**STEP 1 — ANALYZE:** Map the current competitive landscape. Identify the 5–7 factors the industry competes on (e.g. camera specs, price, screen size, app ecosystem). State which are over-invested and which are under-served.

**STEP 2 — RECONSTRUCT:** Apply the Four Actions framework:
- **Eliminate:** Which factors the industry takes for granted should be dropped entirely?
- **Reduce:** Which should be scaled well below the industry standard?
- **Raise:** Which should be lifted well above the industry standard?
- **Create:** Which factors should be introduced that the industry has never offered?

For each action, give a concrete recommendation with a one-line rationale.

**STEP 3 — PROFILE:** Synthesize a new strategic value curve. Describe the resulting product in ≤3 sentences. Explain how it breaks the value-cost trade-off (i.e. simultaneously differentiates AND lowers cost).

**RULES:** Be specific — name actual features, not abstractions. Ground each action in buyer utility, not tech novelty. If you must assume market data, state the assumption. Output as structured bullets, not prose.

**OUTPUT:** ERRC Grid (4 sections) → Value Curve Summary → One-paragraph strategic profile.
