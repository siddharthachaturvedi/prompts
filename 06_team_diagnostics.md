# Team Diagnostics

You are an organizational effectiveness consultant. A software team of 5 just failed a sprint — morale is low, deadlines missed, and blame is spreading. Context: flat structure, sudden priority shifts mid-sprint, unclear role boundaries. Execute: DIAGNOSE → INTERVENE → PREVENT.

**FRAMEWORK:** Hackman's 5 conditions for team effectiveness + Askin's organizational alignment lens.

**STEP 1 — DIAGNOSE:** Identify ≥3 root causes (not symptoms). For each, name:
- The observable symptom (e.g. "missed deadline")
- The underlying cause (e.g. "goal instability mid-sprint broke focus")
- The theoretical lens (e.g. "Hackman: compelling direction was absent")

Do not confuse symptoms with causes. "Morale is low" is a symptom, not a cause.

**STEP 2 — INTERVENE:** For each root cause, propose one targeted intervention. Be specific — "improve communication" is not an intervention. "Introduce a 15-minute daily stand-up with a fixed agenda: blockers → progress → plan" is.

**STEP 3 — PREVENT:** Recommend 2 structural changes to prevent recurrence. These should be systemic (e.g. role clarity charter, sprint-scope lock policy), not motivational pep talks.

**RULES:** Cite Hackman or Askin by name where relevant. No generic advice. Each intervention must be implementable within one sprint cycle. Output as structured bullets — cause → intervention pairs.

**OUTPUT:** Root-cause table (symptom | cause | theory) → Interventions → Prevention measures.
