# Team Diagnostics

**Level:** Intermediate | **Domain:** Organizational Behaviour | **Skill:** Team analysis & problem solving

## Prompt

A software team's recent sprint failed: morale is low and deadlines were missed. Given this scenario (assume a flat team of 5, sudden priority changes, unclear roles), diagnose possible causes and propose interventions. Apply Askin's alignment perspective and Hackman's team effectiveness conditions.

## Frameworks

- **Askin** (strategic alignment)
- **Hackman** (team conditions model)
- Tuckman (storming)
- Personal productivity research

## Expected Deliverables

A concise report (bullets or short paragraphs) listing:
- Potential root causes (e.g. "Ambiguous roles, shifting goals")
- Corresponding fixes (e.g. "Clarify responsibilities, stabilize priorities")

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Strong) | 3 (OK) | 1 (Weak) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Root-cause identification | 3 | At least 3 plausible causes (root-level) | 2 causes (some superficial) | Single or trivial causes |
| Theory integration | 3 | Explicit use of Askin's / Hackman's concepts | One theory mentioned briefly | No theoretical grounding |
| Intervention quality | 3 | Targeted actions for each cause | Some actions, partial match | Vague or ineffective recommendations |
| Clarity | 1 | Well-organized (table or bullets) | Acceptable prose | Disorganized or incomplete |

## LLM Tips

- Use a low temperature for precise cause-effect logic
- Include **stepwise breakdown**: "First list possible causes, then propose fixes"
- Provide an example case breakdown as few-shot if needed
- Encourage the LLM to cite theory names explicitly
