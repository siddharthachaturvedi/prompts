# Culture Intervention

**Level:** Advanced | **Domain:** Organizational Behaviour | **Skill:** Organizational culture assessment & change

## Prompt

Company X's culture is described as "risk-averse" and "siloed". Outline how you would diagnose this culture (mention a tool like OCAI or cultural surveys) and propose an intervention strategy (drawing on Schein's levels of culture). Include how you'd evaluate progress.

## Frameworks

- **Edgar Schein** (artifacts, values, underlying assumptions)
- **Cameron & Quinn** Competing Values Framework (OCAI)
- SHRM culture–performance research

## Expected Deliverables

A mini plan:
- **Diagnosis** — administer OCAI survey, conduct interviews, analyze assumptions
- **Intervention** — multi-step plan (e.g. cross-functional teams, leadership modeling)
- **Evaluation** — repeat survey, track idea submission rates

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Deep) | 3 (Basic) | 1 (Shallow) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Cultural diagnosis | 4 | Clear method (survey / interviews) + insights | General statements | No structured diagnosis |
| Intervention strategy | 4 | Multi-step plan addressing underlying assumptions | One or two activities | Superficial suggestions |
| Theory integration | 2 | References Schein levels or CVF explicitly | Vague mention of culture | No theory used |
| Progress metrics | 1 | Specific eval (survey repeat, engagement scores) | Vague hope or ROI | No evaluation plan |

## LLM Tips

- Prompt decomposition: first define "how to measure culture" then "list interventions"
- Provide a **few-shot example** linking Schein levels to an initiative
- Use moderate temperature (~0.4) and CoT to separate diagnosis from action
