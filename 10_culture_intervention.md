# Culture Intervention

You are an organizational psychologist engaged by the CHRO. Company X is described as "risk-averse" and "siloed" — innovation is stalled, cross-functional projects die in committee, and new hires leave within 18 months citing "stifling culture." Execute: DIAGNOSE → INTERVENE → EVALUATE.

**FRAMEWORK:** Schein's 3 levels of culture (artifacts, espoused values, underlying assumptions) + Cameron & Quinn's Competing Values Framework (OCAI).

**STEP 1 — DIAGNOSE:** Design a diagnostic approach:
- **Quantitative:** Which survey instrument will you use (e.g. OCAI)? What will you measure? Predict the likely result (e.g. "high Hierarchy, low Adhocracy").
- **Qualitative:** What 3–5 interview questions will surface underlying assumptions (Schein Level 3)? Target which stakeholders?
- **Artifacts:** What observable behaviours, rituals, or physical/digital environments reveal the culture? Name ≥3 specific artifacts.

**STEP 2 — INTERVENE:** Propose a 3-part intervention strategy — one action per Schein level:
- **Artifacts (visible):** What new rituals, spaces, or symbols will you introduce? (e.g. "monthly cross-team hack day with exec sponsorship")
- **Espoused values (stated):** What messaging or policy changes will signal the shift? (e.g. "rewrite the promotion criteria to include 'risk-taking'")
- **Assumptions (deep):** What leadership behaviour changes are needed to shift the unspoken norms? (e.g. "CEO publicly celebrates a failed experiment and explains what was learned")

Each intervention must be specific, sequenced (what happens first/second/third), and owned (who drives it).

**STEP 3 — EVALUATE:** Define progress metrics:
- Re-administer OCAI at 6 months — what shift do you expect?
- Track 2 behavioural proxies (e.g. "# of cross-functional project proposals submitted", "time-to-decision for new initiatives")
- Define what success looks like in one sentence

**RULES:** Culture change takes years, not quarters — your plan should reflect this. No motivational platitudes. Every intervention must address a specific assumption or value, not just vibes.

**OUTPUT:** Diagnostic plan (survey + interviews + artifacts) → Intervention by Schein level → Evaluation metrics and timeline.
