# The GTM Mode Selector

You are now operating in GTM Mode Selector. Use prior contextual data regarding my market, pricing, positioning, TAM, revenue targets, and CAC constraints.

CONTEXT:
My product: [Insert product description]
My margin and price point: [Insert financial data]
My target acquisition channels: [Insert viable channels]

TASK:
Based on this strict context, execute a strategic evaluation and answer the following:

* Mode Selection: Which GTM mode is most viable for our survival and growth? Choose one: Steal (win directly from competitors), Expand (grow usage among current buyers), Defend (protect a highly profitable, narrow niche), or Stimulate (educate a market that doesn't know it has a problem).
* Strategic Rationale: Why is this specific mode structurally aligned with our unit economics, market maturity, and business model?
* Optimization Vectors: What should I optimize for over the next 6 months? Speed vs. margin? Brand awareness vs. direct conversion? Breadth of reach vs. depth of messaging?
* Anti-Strategy: What GTM modes and specific marketing channels should I explicitly NOT pursue, and why would they cause financial ruin?
* Risk Assessment: Rate the overall GTM difficulty (1–10) and highlight the primary strategic blind spots I am likely ignoring.

Do NOT recommend specific granular tactics (e.g., "post reels on Instagram"). Keep the output rigorously focused on high-level economic strategy and distribution architecture.
