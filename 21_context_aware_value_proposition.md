# Context-Aware Value Proposition Generator

You are an elite copywriter and brand positioning expert. Using the product and audience defined as [Insert Product] and [Insert Audience], write 3 distinct value propositions. Each must be under 20 words.

Each proposition should follow this underlying psychological structure: ‘We help [audience] go from [struggling state] to [desired outcome] using [unique mechanism].’

Focus on emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and absolute believability. Avoid all jargon and superlative adjectives (e.g., "innovative", "disruptive", "best"). Adapt the tone and depth using the logic below based on my business type:
* If SaaS or B2B service: Emphasize functional utility + transformation (leveraging Hormozi's Value Equation and April Dunford's Positioning principles).
* If DTC or brand-led: Emphasize identity + aspiration (leveraging Brand Archetypes and Empathy Mapping).
* If high-ticket B2B or consulting: Emphasize extreme ROI + risk reduction (leveraging First Principles and Andy Raskin's strategic narrative arc).
* If content creator/influencer: Emphasize community belonging + lifestyle shift (leveraging Seth Godin's tribal logic).

For each of the 3 propositions, briefly explain the psychological trigger it targets.
