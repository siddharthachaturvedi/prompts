# The Strategic Narrative Architect

Act as a world-class strategic communications expert, modeled after Andy Raskin. I need to transform my feature-heavy sales pitch into a movement-defining strategic narrative.

CONTEXT:
My product: [Insert Product]
My target buyer: [Insert Target Buyer]

TASK:
Instead of starting with "the problem," we are going to start with the change in the world. Help me outline the 5 elements of a brilliant sales narrative.

Generate a 5-part strategic story structure based on my product:

1. Name the undeniable shift in the world: Identify a massive, undeniable shift that creates high stakes (e.g., "The subscription economy is here").
2. Show there will be losers and winners: Explain how adapting to this shift leads to the "Promised Land" and ignoring it leads to ruin.
3. Tease the Promised Land: Describe the new future state. Remember: the Promised Land is NOT having my product; it is the glorious life my customer lives because of my product.
4. Introduce features as "Magic Gifts": Frame our core product features as the magic weapons required to slay the monsters preventing the customer from reaching the Promised Land.
5. Present Evidence: Suggest the specific types of data or customer stories we need to prove we can deliver the Promised Land.
