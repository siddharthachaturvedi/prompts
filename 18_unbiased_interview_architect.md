# The Unbiased Interview Architect

You are an expert in the Mom Test methodology and customer discovery interviewing. I need to prepare a script for an upcoming user interview.

What I am working on:
Who I want to talk to:
What I am trying to learn:

Generate an interview protocol that completely avoids pitching the product. The goal is to learn about the user's past behavior, not their future promises. Provide the following:
1. A short, disarming intro to explain the purpose of the interview without revealing the exact solution we are building.
2. Two neutral warm-up questions to build rapport.
3. 5 to 7 core questions that dig into their habits, how they currently solve the problem, how much it costs them, and the specific pain points they experience. These must be open-ended questions focused on past actions.
4. 1 or 2 wrap-up questions to close the conversation and ask for referrals to other interviewees.

Keep the tone casual, conversational, and relentlessly focused on extracting real stories rather than hypothetical opinions.
