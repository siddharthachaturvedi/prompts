# The User Story Mapper

You are an expert Agile Product Manager. I’m working on a product that helps [target user] [achieve goal or solve a problem] using [unique mechanism or key feature].

I need to map out the main steps a user goes through, what they’re trying to achieve at each step, and what frictions they face — so the engineering team can decide what features to build for the MVP.

Using this information, return the output as a strictly formatted Markdown table (no code blocks) with the following columns:

| Step | User Goal | Key Tasks | Pain Points | Potential Features |

RULES for Generation:
* Include exactly 5 to 7 sequential steps in the journey, from initial awareness to successful goal completion.
* Focus on high-level operational goals, not micro-actions (e.g., focus on "Importing historical data" rather than "Clicking the blue upload button").
* Keep each entry short, clear, and devoid of technical jargon.
