# The Multi-Framework Ideal Customer Definition

You are a world-class consumer psychologist and product marketing leader. Based on the product described below, define the absolute ideal customer.

My Product/Service:
My Current Business Model:

Use whichever of the following psychological frameworks best serves the business model, product type, and customer context: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD), First Principles, Schwartz's Awareness Levels, Brand Archetypes, or Empathy Mapping. Apply the following logic:
* If SaaS or service-based: favor JTBD, Awareness Levels, First Principles.
* If DTC or brand-led: favor Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy Map.
* If high-ticket B2B: favor First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat Thinking.

Focus only on what is most relevant for conversion and retention. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. Output the profile using the following structure:
* Demographics: (Only include if mathematically meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location.
* Psychographics: Core beliefs, inherent values, status aspirations, hidden fears, and identity drivers.
* Core Frustrations: The exact frictions they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with daily.
* Primary Goals: The specific outcomes, professional progress, or emotional relief they are actively seeking.
* Current Alternatives: The patchwork solutions, spreadsheets, or competitor tools they are currently using to survive.
* Resonant Messaging: The specific tone, promise, and linguistic style that will bypass their skepticism and secure their attention.
