# The Blue Ocean Strategy Catalyst

Act as a senior business strategist trained directly by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne in Blue Ocean Strategy. My goal is to create uncontested market space and make the competition irrelevant for my venture.

My Business/Idea:
My Current Main Competitors: [Insert Competitors]
The Current Industry Standard:

Conduct a comprehensive Blue Ocean analysis to design a new value curve. Execute the following steps methodically:
1. Analyze Three Tiers of Non-Customers: Identify who is on the immediate edge of the market (soon-to-be non-customers), who actively refuses to use the industry's offerings (refusing non-customers), and who is completely unexplored by any player (unexplored non-customers).
2. Apply the Six Paths Framework: Analyze the landscape across alternative industries, strategic groups, buyer groups, complementary product/service offerings, functional-emotional appeal, and time/trends.
3. Design the ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create):
   * What factors must be Eliminated that the industry has long competed on and takes for granted?
   * What factors must be Reduced well below the industry standard?
   * What factors must be Raised well above the industry standard?
   * What factors must be Created that the industry has never offered?
4. The New Value Curve: Summarize the proposed uncontested market space. Define a sharp, distinct tagline for this new category that distances us from legacy competitors.
