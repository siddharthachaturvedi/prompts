# Change Management Plan

**Level:** Advanced | **Domain:** Organizational Behaviour | **Skill:** Change planning & leadership

## Prompt

Your company will migrate all employees to a new CRM system in 3 months. As the change lead, create a change management plan: perform a readiness assessment, outline phases (communication, training, pilot, roll-out), and include strategies to handle resistance (drawing on Kotter's change steps and Prosci's ADKAR model).

## Frameworks

- **Kotter's** 8-step process
- **ADKAR** (Awareness → Desire → Knowledge → Ability → Reinforcement)
- **Lewin's** Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze

## Expected Deliverables

A change plan document with sections:
- **Assessment** — current state, readiness
- **Phases** — Awareness campaign, Training, Pilot, Go-Live
- **Risk Mitigation** — e.g. "Address fear via sponsorship"

## Scoring Rubric (10 points)

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Comprehensive) | 3 (Satisfactory) | 1 (Lacking) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Change phases | 4 | All major phases included with clear timing | Some phases; missing detail | Unstructured or missing key phases |
| Use of theory | 3 | Explicit Kotter / ADKAR references | Implicit mention | No theoretical basis |
| Stakeholder strategy | 2 | Addresses leadership buy-in, champions, communication | Basic communication plan | Ignores key stakeholders |
| Assessment & metrics | 1 | Clear current state diagnosis and success metrics | Basic survey or anecdotal | No assessment / metrics |

## LLM Tips

- Use **temperature ~0.3** for structured plan
- Break it down (CoT): first list steps, then flesh each
- Optionally include a **table template** example in prompt
