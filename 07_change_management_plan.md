# Change Management Plan

You are a change management lead. Your company is migrating 500 employees to a new CRM system in 90 days. History: two prior tool migrations failed due to poor adoption. Execute: ASSESS → PHASE → DEFEND.

**FRAMEWORK:** Kotter's 8 steps + Prosci's ADKAR (Awareness → Desire → Knowledge → Ability → Reinforcement).

**STEP 1 — ASSESS:** Diagnose readiness across 3 dimensions:
- **Awareness:** Do employees know *why* the change is happening? (estimate % who do)
- **Ability:** What's the current CRM skill level? (estimate on a 1–5 scale)
- **Resistance hotspots:** Which teams or roles will resist most, and why?

State assumptions where needed. The assessment must be specific enough to drive action.

**STEP 2 — PHASE:** Create a 90-day plan in 3 phases:
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2):** Urgency + vision (Kotter Steps 1–3). What do you communicate, to whom, through what channel?
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3–8):** Training + pilot (ADKAR: Knowledge + Ability). Which department pilots first? What does training look like? How many hours?
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12):** Full rollout + reinforcement. How do you sustain adoption? What's the support structure?

For each phase, name the ADKAR stage and the Kotter step being addressed.

**STEP 3 — DEFEND:** Anticipate the top 3 resistance behaviours (e.g. "shadow systems", "selective non-compliance", "vocal sceptics") and state your countermeasure for each.

**RULES:** No vague plans. Every action needs a who, what, and when. "Communicate the vision" is insufficient — specify the channel, audience, and message. Include at least one success metric per phase.

**OUTPUT:** Readiness assessment → Phased plan (table or timeline) → Resistance countermeasures.
